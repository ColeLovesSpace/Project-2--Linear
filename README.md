Numerical Methods Project 2 - Linear Algebra

This repository contains a Julia notebook which approximates the $\sin(x)$ function and quantifies the errors of the approximation. It also explores how to take derivatives of our polynomial approximation of our functions. This can be ran as any other notebook on a machine capable of executing Julia code. 

## 1)

We start by studying our polynomial approximation to the $\sin(x)$ funciton. When approximated with a degree 10 polynomial we see strong aggreement with our approximated function and the actual function.
